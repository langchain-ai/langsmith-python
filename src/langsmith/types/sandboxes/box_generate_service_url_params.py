    Access selects the login mode, mutually exclusive with the minted token. Omit

    "restricted" — LangSmith login: the sandbox's creator, or any user with
    SandboxesExec on it (admins by default). "workspace" — LangSmith login: any
    member of the owning workspace. "off" — remove an existing LangSmith login grant
    and mint a token. A LangSmith login grant is durable; token mode is refused

    EmbedOrigins are the pages allowed to show a LangSmith login service URL in an

    https://app.example.com (http only for localhost). Valid only with access
    "restricted" or "workspace". Each call sets the URL's whole list, so omitting
    the field removes any origins set before.
